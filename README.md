## Creating a project

- To create a project in Django run the following command

`django-admin startproject nameOfTheProject`

- This will create a `nameOfTheProject` directory in your current directory

## Development Server

- To check if everything is installed, run the following command

` python manage.py runserver `

An app is a web application that does something – e.g., a blog system, a database of public records or a small poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.
